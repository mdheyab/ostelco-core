# Instructions to install neo4j on GCP

For enterprise version of Neo4j, a `casual` cluster can be created in GCP using `App Launcher`.
Neo4j is licensed as A-GPL.
Since `ostelco-core` is an open source project, we can use Enterprise version of Neo4j.
This setup is not intended for production since that requires serious Operation and Maintenance of Neo4j.
